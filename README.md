# EC601_mini_project1&3
This my mini project 3 assignment. Becuase I think that my nin project 1 which did 2 months ago is not good, I decide to update my mini project 1 code. In this mini project, you can see my new mini_1 files which are twitter.py and video.py. I wrote MongoDB and MySQL data base according to w3Schools.com. I learned how to write datebase from this website. You can download all of my files for demo.
